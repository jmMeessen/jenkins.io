= A kubernetes journey on Azure

With the ongoing migration to an Azure ecosystem, I would like to share my thoughts about one of the biggest concern we faced: orchestrating container infrastructure.

What would the workflow from dev to prod look like?

Before going deeper in the workflow's challenges, we knew, from the start, that following subjects were very important.

Git:: 
  We found it mandatory to keep track of all the infrastructure changes in a Git repository (including secrets)
  in order to facilitate reviewing, validation, rollback,... 

Tests::
  Jenkins infra contributors are geographicaly distributed and on different timezone.
  Getting feedback can take time. So we relied a lot on tests before any changes +
 
Automation::
  The change submitter is not necessarly the person who will deploy it.
  Repetitive tasks are error prone and a waste of time. +
  For these reasons, all steps must be automated and stay as simple as possible.

A generic workflow should like look this

  __________       _________       ______________               
  |         |      |        |      |             |
  | Changes | ---->|  Test  |----->| Deployment  |
  |_________|      |________|  ^   |_____________|                           
                               | 
                         ______________
                        |             |
                        | Validation  |
                        |_____________|
----


We identified two main approaches:

* The Jenkins Way: Jenkins is triggered by a git commit, runs the tests and after validation, Jenkins deploys changes into production.

* The Puppet way: Jenkins is triggered by a git commit, runs the tests and after validation, it triggers puppet to deploys into production.

Let's discuss these two approaches in details.

In this approach, Jenkins is used to test, validate and deploy our Kubernetes configuration files.  +
Kubectl can be run on a directory and is idempotent. This means that we can run it as often as we want: the result will not change. +
Theoretically, it's the simplest way. The only thing needed is to run 'kubectl' command each time Jenkins detects changes.

The following Jenkinsfile gives an example of this workflow.

.Jenkinsfile
----
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Init'){
        steps { 
          sh 'curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl'
        }
      }
      stage('Test'){
        steps { 
          sh 'Run tests'
        }
      }
      stage('Deploy'){
        steps { 
          sh './kubectl apply -R true -f my_project'
        }
      }
    }
  }
----

As the devil is in the details, it was not as easy as it looked at first sight.
We quickly faced several issues.

===== Order matters

Some resources needed to be deployed before others. +
A workaround was to use numbers as file names. But this adds extra logic
at file name level.
  
  Ex:
    my_project/00-nginx-ingress
    my_project/09-www.jenkins.io

===== Portability

The deployment environments needed to be the same across development machines and Jenkins host. +

Even if it's a well known challenge, it was not easy to achieve. +
The more the project grew, the more our scripts needed additional tools (Make, Bats, jq, gpg, ...). +
The more tools we used, the more issues appeared because of the different versions used.

Another challenge that emerged when dealing with different environments was, how to manage environment's specific configurations (dev, prod, ...)

Is it better to define different configuration files per environment? But this means code duplications or using file templates that require more tools (sed, jinja2, erb). And more work.
But less code to write and maintain.

There isn't a golden rule and the answer is probably in between.

In any case, the good news is that Jenkinsfile provides an easy way to execute tasks from a docker image. +
Which image can contain all our environment. We can even use different docker images for each step. +

In the following example, I use the `my_env` docker image. It contains all the tools needed to test, validate and deploy changes.

.Jenkinsfile
----
pipeline{
  agent {
    docker{
      image 'my_env:1.0'
    }
  }
  options{
    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '10'))
    disableConcurrentBuilds()
    timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS')
  }
  triggers{
    pollSCM('* * * * *')
  }
  stages{
    stage('Init'){
      steps{
        // Init everything required to deploy our infra  
        sh 'make init'
      }
    }
    stage('Test'){
      steps{
       // Run tests to validate changes
       sh 'make test'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy'){
      steps{
       // Deploy changes in production
       sh 'make deploy'
      }
    }
  }
  post{
    always {
      sh 'make notify'
    }
  }
}

===== Secret credentials

// "publish publicly"... But don't have a better idea.

Big subject that covers many concerns and is very hard to fulfill +
For obvious reasons, we couldn't publish publicly the credentials used within the infra project. +
On the order side, we needed to keep track and share them. Particulary for the jenkins node that deploys our cluster. +
This means that we needed a way to encrypt or decrypt those credentials depending on permissions, environments,...
We analyzed two different approaches to handle this

  1. Storing secrets in a key management tool like https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/[Key Vault] or https://www.vaultproject.io/[Vault] and use them like a kubernetes "secret" type of resource. +
    -> Unfortunately, these tools are not yet integrated in Kubernetes. But we may come back to this option later.
    https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/10439[Kubernetes-HashicorpVault]

  2. Publishing and encrypting using a public gpg key.
     This means that everybody can encrypt credentials for the infrastructure project but only the owner of the private key can decrypt credentials. +
     This solution imply
      * Scripting, as secrets need to be decrypted at deployment time.
      * Templates, as secrets value will change depending on the environment.
     -> Each Jenkins node should only have the private key to decrypt secrets associated to its environment.

===== Scripting

Finally, it was hard to work without it. +
Our initial Jenkinsfile, with only one `kubectl` command to run, became a bunch of scripts.
There were so many situations requiring additional steps.

* Resources needed to be updated only in some situations
* Secrets needed to be encrypted/decrypted
* Tests needed to be run.
* ...

At the end, the amount of scripts used to deploy the kubernetes resources started to grow a lot.
And we started questioning ourself: "Aren't we reinventing the wheel?"

== The Puppet way

Puppet is used to template and deploy all kubernetes configurations files needed to orchestrate our cluster in a controlled workspace.
It is also used to automate basic operations like 'apply' or 'remove' resources based on file changed.

----

The main benefit of this approach, is to let puppet manage the environment and run common tasks. 
And if needed, we still have a place where we can go to run uncommon operations.

-> https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/tree/staging/dist/profile/manifests/kubernetes[Examples],

Let's compare the puppet approach with a full jenkins approach

===== Order matter
With the puppet approach, it becomes easy to define priorities as
puppet provides relationship meta parameters and the function 'require' 
-> https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.9/lang_relationships.html[Puppet-relationships]

Remark: Currently, Jenkins puppet code only applies configuration when it detects files’ changes. +
But it would be better to compare local files with the cluster configurations in order to trigger required updates.
We didn't find a good way to do it yet.

===== Portability
As puppet is used to configure working environments, it becomes easier to be sure that all tools are present and correctly configured.
It's also easier to replicate environments and run tests on them with tools like http://rspec-puppet.com/[Rpec-puppet], http://serverspec.org/[Serverspec] or https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]


===== Secret credentials
As we were already using encrypted Hiera with puppet, we decided to continue to use it.

===== Scripting
Of course puppet DSL is used. +
And even if it seems harder at the beginning, 
Puppet simplifies a lot the management of kubernetes configurations files.

== Conclusion
It was much easier to bootstrap the project with a full CI workflow as long as the kubernetes project stays basic. +

But as soon as the project grew and we started deploying different applications per environment, with different configurations,... +
It became easier to delegate kubernetes configuration files management to puppet.
